The PSI Support project aims to improve psychological conditioning, with a focus on depression and anxiety. It is a application with some features that keeps its edge. This project has been underway for five years, where family and close friends had some type of mental disorder, but did not know how to get help. So we felt the need to create this project.

### Introduction

In Brazil, about 86% of the Brazilian population has some type of mental illness, such as anxiety and depression proven by the WHO (World Health Organization). Although some diseases have no cure, there are treatments that can reduce the impact. Therefore, technology has been a key means of including psychological health in order to reduce the problem. The PSI Support application was created with the aim of decreasing the percentage of people with depression and anxiety in the world and also decreasing suicide rates. The application seeks in the user inner peace and the improvement of their mental health.
